Update using Bootstrap 4 Summary

I have enhanced many things by using Bootstrap 4. I had some trouble because I did not realize that many elements in the Bootstrap 3 do not work on Bootstrap 4. I thought that If I used Bootstrap 4, I could also include things from Bootstrap 3, but that was not the case. Anyway, the very first thing I have done is to divide my webpage into two columns using the basic Grid feature in Bootstrap 4 because I wanted a different layout for my webpage. I divided the left column with a span of 4 and the right column with a span of 8. Both of them are in small classes. Then I have created a standard navigation bar on the very top, for navigating to external websites like our school, Github, and Blackboard. Then I created bordered buttons for each assignment in the left column, which I think it is much nicer to look at than just an unordered list that I had before. Also, in the left column, I have created a progress bar that shows how many assignments are accomplished. The progress bar is animated and has a label displaying the current status. Moving outside two columns, I have added a famous quote by Linus Torvalds using blockquote. Then, for my moving selfie image, I just shaped my image into a circle. Lastly, I have added alert messages to let visitors know that assignments will be updated later. 
Outside the Bootstrap, I have changed the colors of pretty much everything I had before to make it look nicer and simpler. I have modified some formatting, sizing, margins, animations, paddings, email links, and so on to the .css file just to enhance my website visually.
