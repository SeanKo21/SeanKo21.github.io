Description: For HW6 I used my HW5 as a guide and a baseline.
Not much has been changed for my html and css files. Other than
adding jQuery files in html and changing error message color in css.
I pretty much only worked with my js file "mult_table.js"
I implemented jQuery Validation plugin. I had to download the file
from https://jqueryvalidation.org/ because something went wrong for
an unknown reason. I have save those files in validator folder.
So, now my implementation make the error show up right away and
responsive depending on user's input. I have customized my error
messages and they should correctly pop up next to the input box.
My comments will be next to the input boxes in RED.
