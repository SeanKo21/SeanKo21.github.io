Description: Using JavaScript to create dynamic multiplication table.
I just made the design as simple as possible and focused more on the
JavaScript part since that is the main goal is to learn the basic and
implement JavaScript. I have tested as much as I can to sort out any errors.
Error message will show in red under "Table Maker" box or above the table.
I have included the link back to my main homepage at the bottom in blue.
