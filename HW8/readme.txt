Description:
This is my implementation of the Scrabble. I have to say that this was the hardest
assignment that I ever had from the CS course.
I mostly worked creating and implementing the scrabble.js file than anything else.
I have commented as much as I can on the scrabble.js file.

There is one thing that does not work on my SCRABBLE.
My board does not get cleared after each round. Therefore, tiles have to be added
on top of the uncleared board. From the rubric, it says that it's a 3 points deduction
I just could not get it right somehow. However, everything else should work.
I also implemented that so the user can put the tile back to the rack if he or she
wants to. However, it only works while the user is dragging and dropping the tiles
it does not move when it is already settled into the board by clicking on the next
turn. Also, you cannot move your tiles from previous turns. Also, my implementation
do not allow any gaps between words and shows error when next turn is clicked.
I did not implement any extra credit tasks.
Thank you.
